This is an application which lets you easily use CyberGhost's OpenVPN-compatible servers in order to anonymize yourself. You may need to have a CyberGhost premium account for this application to work - I do myself, and I haven't tested without one. I made this application because using OpenVPN from the CLI is needlessly repetitive.
After you login, your CyberGhost credentials will be stored as a Base64 encoded string. If you do not want this, delete the ‘credentials’ file in the startup directory after you have finished using the program. 
You must have at least one Linux/Router device added to your CyberGhost control panel in order to use this program, or alternatively you must have at least one free device slot (the program will attempt to create a device to use, but will not attempt to remove any of your own devices if there are no free slots. All this can be configured here: https://account.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us/login#/account 
If you’re not interested in the source code (which is admittedly rather haphazard, as I wrote this tool primarily for my own use), then you can download a precompiled binary with all dependencies embedded here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7543521/Executables/CyberGhosty.exe
